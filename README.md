# Disease-prediction-diabetes-and-heart-disease-using-Machine-Learning-and-Python-
A webpage designed using Python's streamlit library to predict diseases such as diabetes and heart disease. The Machine learning model creation is done using Linear regression and SVM.

Open Jupyter Notebook. And upload these files.
dependencies.ipynb consists of all the necessary dependencies needed for this project. Run it and install all dependencies.

diabetes_prediction_dataset.csv and heart.csv are the datasets used which is downloaded from kaggle database
Links of datasets are given below:
https://www.kaggle.com/code/mukulsharma877/diabetes-pred-randomforest-xgboost-catboost/input 
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/heart-attack-analysis-prediction-dataset

diabetes-Multiple disease prediction system.ipynb is the diabetes prediction code. Run it.
heart-Multiple disease prediction system.ipynb is the heart disease prediction code. Run it also.

Files in .sav extension is our created Machine Learning model.

Open terminal or Anaconda prompt and run the code for front end. That is website which is multi_disease_prediction.py.

Upadate file paths in all files as where those files are residing in your system.

Run the streamlit app using:
  streamlit run "C:\Users\HP\hackathon\multi_disease_prediction.py"
  
  Update file path here also respective to your file path.
